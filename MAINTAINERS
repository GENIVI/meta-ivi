Please submit any patches against meta-ivi to the maintainers
(cc:ing the meta-ivi mailing list (genivi-meta-ivi@lists.genivi.org))

You may also contact the maintainers directly in case you have any questions
on a particular meta-ivi topic, but please try to do the following first:

  - look in the GENIVI baseline JIRA
    (https://at.projects.genivi.org/jira/projects/BASE/ ) to see if
    a problem has already been reported

  - look through recent entries of the meta-ivi mailing list archives
    (http://lists.genivi.org/mailman/listinfo/genivi-meta-ivi ) to see if other
    people have run into similar problems or had similar questions
    answered.

When creating patches, please use something like:
    git format-patch -s --subject-prefix='meta-ivi][PATCH' origin

When sending patches, please use something like:
    git send-email --to=yong-il.joh@windriver.com \
                   --cc=genivi-meta-ivi@lists.genivi.org <generated patch>
