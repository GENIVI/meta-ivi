meta-ivi, the Yocto layer for In-Vehicle Infotainment
=====================================================

This layer's purpose is to add In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) support when
used with Poky.  The goal is to make the Yocto Project reference system
Poky GENIVI compliant.

Branch Policy
-------------

- New development is done on **master** branch and most new change requests
  (PRs) should be proposed as changes to master, unless you know they are
  applicable to a particular release only.
- In general, prefer a linear commit history (rebase and cherry-pick),
  applying merge commits only where absolutely necessary to sort out a
  complex merge situation (which we should rarely have).
- The maintainer shall ensure that relevant patches are cherry-picked to
  every branch where they apply. I.e. patches should be back-ported *at
  minimum* to the Support Window versions, as defined below.
- Meta-ivi uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). 
- The release schedule is driven by a time plan.
- The GENIVI Compliance Specification is released annually, while meta-ivi is
  released bi-annually.  Major numbers follow the compliance specification.
  We will create 14.x-rocko branch together with the specification 14.0.0
  and 14.x-sumo half way to 15.0.0.
- Meta-ivi updates regularly to follow Yocto/Poky releases.
- Somewhere near a new major release of the specification, a numbered
  release branch (e.g. 14.x-rocko and 14.x-sumo) is created from master, and
  the new branch goes into stabilization/release phase.
- In the middle between the specification version 14.0 and 15.0 a numbered
  branch is created for the 14.x-sumo meta-ivi release.
- After a versioned release, the release branch remains for maintenance and
  updates.

Tag Policy
----------
- Meta-ivi creates tags, in accordance with semver. Major numbers follow
  the GENIVI Compliance Specification. Examples: 14.0.0, 14.0.1, 14.1.0
- Releases are created from the respective working branch.
- GitHub releases are also created.
- When layer upgrades are done, version numbers will be as follows:
- The versions used on 14.x-rocko will start at 14.0.0.
- The versions used on 14.x-sumo will start on 14.50.0 to keep the major version
  numbers in sync.
- Note: Updates to the 14.0.0 release would then become 14.0.1 and/or 14.1.0,
  which can be released __after__ 14.50.0.
- Tags of the type P-0.1, P-0.2 etc, are internal tags used for some
  prereleases.

Support Window (Bugfixes, improvements)
---------------------------------------

- Because of available resources, and often low engagement from those companies
that have settled on a version and gone into a production project, support
is given for only the most recently released version, and *one* version
before it.

Support Window (Security)
-------------------------

- If critical security fixes are identified, the maintainer should apply
them (if applicable) to the most recently released version and *two*
versions before it.

**Note** however that there is currently no quantified or documented
commitment to tracking CVEs, nor any guarantee to apply all possible
security fixes.  While it is of course tracked to the best of the
maintainer's ability, the project is dependent on community input.  All the
_responsibility remains on the adopting companies_ to secure their final
products.

Using the above git SHAs and the master meta-ivi branch,
 bitbaking pulsar-image is known to work
 (the pulsar-image build should be aligned with GENIVI 14.0).

For creating a specific GENIVI compliant image version, please make sure you
git checkout the related meta-ivi branch and follow the build instructions
located in the README.md file of that branch.  So for example, to build
an image that should be GENIVI 9.0 compliant, checkout the meta-ivi 9.0 branch,
and follow the README.md part of that branch.  As does the GENIVI Alliance
we only support the current and the previous version.  Any version older
than that is not supported any more, and therefore may not build or run.

Supported Machines
------------------

We do smoke test the builds of the three supported machines:

* QEMU (IA-32) - emulated machine: qemux86
* QEMU (x86-64) - emulated machine: qemux86-64
* QEMU (ARM64) - emulated machine: qemuarm64

Adaptation and testing with other hardware BSPs is typically done by other
community projects like the GENIVI Development Platform, and by product
companies.

Please check on our [wiki](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/PROJ/meta-ivi)
regarding any community supported machines.
For example there Renesas provides a public Board Support Package (BSP)
available for use with meta-ivi.
